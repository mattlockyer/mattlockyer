                    Overview:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Now that your application has been accepted by the client, you're ready to write a report. Your report should chronical the creation of each object used in your software.
                    Interactions between objects should also be summarized. Given your report, another programmer should be able to recreate the application in a similar fashion without
                    seeing the application. It is
                    important that you use the language of the course and computer science in general to describe each detail of your application so that a fellow programmer may use it
                    as a blueprint. Now that the application is finished, provide some rationale as to whether it was successful or not. Remember to include all details: what worked,
                    what didn't, and what still needs to be done.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Your report should meet these requirements:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the language of the course:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every detail about an object should be described using the correct <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="window.open('terms.html','Terms','width=670,height=600,location=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=1,status=0,toolbar=0,resizable=0')">terms</a></li>
                            <li>Double check that you are using the right <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="window.open('terms.html','Terms','width=670,height=600,location=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=1,status=0,toolbar=0,resizable=0')">terms</a> and syntax</li>

                            <li>Make sure the description is clear given the code sample</li>
                            <li>A code snippet says a lot, but it's NOT a replacement for summary</li>
