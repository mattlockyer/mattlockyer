					In this assignment, you will give life to your character by animating it. Then you will give your character the ability to move around screen.

                    Create a new character or use your character from Assignment 1.<br />
                    Separate your character code and scene code into two methods.<br />
                    Draw your character in at least two different states.<br />
                    Add a parameter to your character method to keep track of which state it should display.<br/>

                    Declare global variables to store: x, y, and velocity x, y for your character.<br />
                    Examples:

                <ul>
                    <li>float xPos, yPos, xVel, yVel;</li>
                    <li>float xPosition, yPosition, xVelocity, yVelocity;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Initialize your character movement variables inside the setup method.<br />
                    Choose your own starting location.<br />
                    Examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>xPos = random(width); //random x position inside the window</li>
                    <li>xVel = random(-4, 4); //random velocity, moving either left or right</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Move your character based on their given velocity.<br />
                    Reverse direction when your character hits a wall.<br />
                </p>
