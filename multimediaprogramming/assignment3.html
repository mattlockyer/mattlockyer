                    Overview:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We are going to create a grid layout of shape objects in order to create stunning patterns and effects.
                    Our shape objects will be interactive and react to the user input via the mouse. This will allow us to 
                    parameterize our pattern and work with data in the context of a design constraint. Samples:
