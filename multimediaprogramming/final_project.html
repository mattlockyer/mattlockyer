                    Overview:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You have been asked to create a software application for a client. The client wants you to sell him/her an application concept
                    that can be entertaining, visually appealing (stunning), and work well. When the client is convinced of your proposal you will be asked
                    to create the application for the client. In addition to looking good on the surface, the client also
                    needs the application to be coded properly (architecture, comments, naming conventions), so that it may be extended upon in future versions.
                    It will be important to provide the client with an application and source code that is awesome so that they will hire you again.
                </p>
