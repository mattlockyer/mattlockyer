                    Overview:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You have a choice between building a game-based assignment or a generative art poster. Each option is made up of a design brief explaining 
                    what the client (we, your teachers) want and code requirements to make sure you are becoming a Processing ninja. 
                    Choose one option and begin designing. This assignment is a warm up to the Final Project that starts in a couple weeks.
                </p>

                <p>Remember: this is a two week project. Confine the scope of your design to something that can be built in two weeks. 
                    Ask you TA if you are not sure if your design is able to be completed in two weeks.</p>

                    Game Design Brief:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Create a simple game that has a player character and 2 types of "enemies". Keep track of the score. 
                    The choice of how the game works is up to you. You could do anything from a futuristic version of asteroids to a Mario style side scroller arcade game. 
                    It is up to you. Keep the game mechanics simple. Focus on polishing one or two key game play elements.

                <p>
                    Create a sketch that can be influenced by the <strong>keyboard</strong> or <strong>mouse</strong> to create a piece of generative art work.
                    It may be geometric. It may be organic. Use your knowledge of drawing shapes and animation to make a stunning piece.
                    To constrain your thought process, the art piece must be an interpretation of the season Autumn.
