                            Programming is like learning a language. The more you practice the more articulate you become. The ability to be able
                            to express EXACTLY what you wish is a powerful one. The more you <em>practice</em>, the broader your expressive vocabulary
                            will become and the greater your ability.
                        </p>

                            <li>Practice the concepts shown in lecture for a more full understanding</li>
                            <li>Do not rely on lectures, labs, assignments to be enough to learn the content. Practice on your own time.</li>
                            <li>Think up your own exercises</li>
                            <li>Make it fun, be creative, and focus on producing the best work you possibly can.</li>

                            A lot of things are difficult if you approach them with the wrong attitude. We are aware that programming may not be
                            "your thing", however it is part of the curriculum and you must learn something in order to pass. Would you rather be
                            miserable doing something you have to, or happy?
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get excited</li>
                            <li>Try not to think or speak negatively about the course</li>
                            <li>You do not "suck" at programming</li>
                            <li>Manage your time, stay alert and be positive</li>
                        </ul>

						<p>
							Programming is hard. Keep at it even when it gets tough and you'll be amazed at what you have done by the end of the course.
