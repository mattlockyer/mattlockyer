                </h1>
                <p>
                    You have been given a design brief for a software application, as defined by the <a href="final_project.html#req">Final Project</a> page. There are
                    requirements to fulfill and you program must be functioning, visually appealing and entertaining. The purpose
                    of your proposal will be to develop a description of your application and how it will meet the clients requirements.
                    Your design should consider all requirements and their implementation in the form of a <a href="architecture.html">UML diagram</a>. With a solid
                    proposal, you will have no trouble executing your assignment and there should be no ambiguity.
